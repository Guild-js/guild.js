# Welcome!
Welcome to the guild.js v1.0.0 documentation.

## About
guild.js is a powerful [node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to interact with the
[Guilded API](https://www.guilded.gg/blog/guilded-bot-api-is-coming) very easily.

- Object-oriented
- Predictable abstractions
- Performant
- 100% coverage of the Guilded API

## Release
Guilded API is running on its early access stages. The complete package will be available when the api is available to the public.

## Installation
**Node.js 8.0.0 or newer is required.**  
Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.
